Welcome to the Data Science repository! Here, I have curated a collection of all the basics of data science which includes Basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas and MatPlotLib. All the jupyter notebooks and program implementations are solely based on examples from the book **Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney**. Feel free to explore the repository and reach out in case of any issues.
