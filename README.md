Welcome to the Data Science repository! Here, I have curated a collection of all the basics of data science which includes Basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas and MatPlotLib. All the jupyter notebooks and program implementations are solely based on examples from the book ***Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney***. You can download the raw file of the book from <a href="Data-Science/assets">PDF</a>.
